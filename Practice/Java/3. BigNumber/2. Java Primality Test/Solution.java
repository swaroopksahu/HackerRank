/*
 * NOTE: I use isProbablePrime() with certainty = 10 to achieve 99.9% accuracy.
 * However, even certainty = 1 (which achieves 50% accuracy) is enough to pass
 * the HackerRank test cases. isProbablePrime() is always 100% certain if it
 * tells you if a number is "not prime". If it says "prime", it's only 99.9%
 * certain. It may be the case that it just hasn't found a prime number number
 * that divides the BigInteger yet.
